<center>ðŸª»ðŸŒ¸Welcome to my Garden!ðŸ“–ðŸ‘‹</center>
<p> </p>
<center>Come have a look around.</center>
<p> </p>
<center>There are many things here for you to explore and it's ever-growing. This is where I will collect various documents on a variety of topics - some fandom related, some original analysis essays, and possibly some blog posts. This site will act as a portfolio, information center, and a place to drop my musings. So come along for the ride, if you want, and let's see where this train of thought is headed!</center>
